# Bank-Customer-Segmentation
The competition in the banking sector is increasing. To improve their services and retain and attract clients, banking and non-bank institutions need to modernize their marketing and customer strategies through personalization.

There are various data science models that could aid these efforts. Here, we focus on customer segmentation analysis.

# Project Description
Customer or market segmentation helps develop more effective investment and personalization strategies with the available information about clients. This is the process of grouping customers based on common characteristics, such as demographics or behaviors. This substantially improves targeting.

In this project, we segment Indian bank customers using data from more than one million transactions. We extract valuable information from these clusters and build dashboards with the insights. The final outputs can be used to improve products and marketing strategies.

# Methodology
1. Define the questions you would like to answer with the data
2. Collect the customer dataset
3. Clean the data
4. Perform exploratory data analysis to have a better understanding of the data
5. Perform feature preprocessing
6. Train clustering models to segment the data into a selected number of groups
7. Conduct cluster analysis to extract insights
8. Build dashboards with the insights

# Expected Output
Dashboards with marketing insights extracted from the segmented customers.
